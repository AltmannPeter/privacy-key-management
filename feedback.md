## Context

For a general introduction, see [Hierarchical Deterministic Keys for the European Digital Identity Wallet](README.md). In the current document, the authors develop and share structured feedback on one part of the Wallet Toolbox: the [Architecture and Reference Framework](https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/arf/) (ARF). the purpose of this feedback is to enable implementation of Hierarchical Deterministc Keys.

By enabling Hierarchical Deterministic Keys, we aim for interoperability with a concrete and desirable cryptographic architecture in the context of person identification data and some (qualified) electronic attestations of attributes. We do not suggest to mandate the application of this cryptographic architecture for all digital identity documents. Instead, we aim to address two risks to the ARF and subsequently the implementing acts: the risk of accidentally disabling desirable technical solutions, and the risk of accidentally requiring undesirable technical solutions.
